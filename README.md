The purpose of this project is to design and implement a functioning microcontroller using Verilog HDL and Xilinx Vivado. The microcontroller consists of an arithmetic logic unit (ALU), a program counter (PC), a memory address register (MAR), a memory data register (MDR), the memory module, an instruction register (IR), two general purpose I/O ports (GPIO 1/2), four 16-bit registers, an instruction decoder, and finally the finite state machines that generate the modules control signals. The processor will be able to execute the add, subtract, not, and, or, xor, and xnor logic operations on 16-bit data. It will also be able to move data to and from the memory and registers so that the results of these operations can be stored. The two GPIO registers are there as a potential interface between other pieces of hardware such as external sensors or electric motors. Additional functionality will be added (UART, SPI, I2C, et) to make this a fully functioning microcontroller.
